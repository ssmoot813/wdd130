        The Cosmere is an interconnected universe created by author Brandon Sanderson. It’s the setting for many of his fantasy series, including *Mistborn*, *Stormlight Archive*, *Elantris*, and *Warbreaker*. My site, Beyond Allomancy, helps readers explore and understand the deeper connections between these worlds.<br><br>

        Fans often find the Cosmere’s complexity intimidating. Beyond Allomancy will simplify these ideas by explaining how each planet’s magic system works and how they connect. Visitors will come here to learn about the Cosmere’s structure, discover reading orders, and dive deeper into theories.<br><br>

        This website is designed for readers who love epic fantasy, detailed worldbuilding, and clever magic systems. Unlike wikis that can feel overwhelming, Beyond Allomancy will focus on clear explanations, visuals, and easy navigation.

      <h3>Allomancy</h3>
      <p>
        Allomancy is the metal-based magic system from the *Mistborn* series. Users, called Allomancers, gain powers by ingesting and burning specific metals — each granting unique abilities from enhanced strength to emotional influence.<br><br>

        An Allomancer must swallow metal flakes and “burn” them internally to release power. Most can use only one metal, but Mistborns can burn all. The system feels both magical and scientific, with clear rules and balance.<br><br>

        Fans love Allomancy’s logical structure and creativity. My site will include charts explaining each metal’s effect and role within the Cosmere’s larger system of Investiture.<br><br>

        Although Allomancy exists only on Scadrial, it’s part of the wider framework of Investiture shared across the Cosmere. Understanding it provides insight into other systems too.

      </ul>
      <h3>Other Magic Systems</h3>
      <p>
        Each planet in the Cosmere has unique magic, from AonDor’s glowing symbols in *Elantris* to Surgebinding’s control of gravity in *Stormlight Archive*. Despite differences, they all stem from the same cosmic principles.<br><br>

        These systems reflect their cultures and environments — Stormlight draws from energy in storms, Awakening uses color and Breath, and AonDor relies on written forms of power. Each reveals more about its world’s people and history.<br><br>

        While Allomancy is a great entry point, exploring others helps readers appreciate Sanderson’s full creativity. My site encourages readers to see how each world connects into one grand design.<br><br>

        Beyond Allomancy will grow to include theory discussions, visuals, and updates as Sanderson releases new books, making it a long-term fan resource.
